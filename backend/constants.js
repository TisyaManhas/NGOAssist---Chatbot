the training calendar and spread it across 8-10 months of the year considering the fact that
you will have assignments, holidays and internships. Please see the annual training
calendar for 2020-21 on page 12.
In which language are the training sessions held?
English language will be the medium of instruction for all the training sessions.
What do I have to bring for the training session?
Always carry following things with you for training sessions:
● Laptop (Especially for technical training)
● Notebook
● Pen and Pencil
● Folder to carry handouts, notes
What trainings will I be invited for?
The training curriculum is designed in such a way that every semester you will study
different modules. You will be invited for all the modules that you are supposed to study in
the particular semester. It could be the case that what you studied in Semester 1 will have a
direct link to another module in Semester 2.
Do I have to attend all the trainings?
Yes. You will be invited for all the trainings which are part of your curriculum calendar.
Where will the training be held?
Trainings would be virtual through online mode. On some occasions such as Field Visits,
Outbounds, Corporate Visits we may organize the trainings in other locations. The Centre
Team will inform you well in advance about the venue.
How do I give feedback about training?
You are requested to give your honest feedback about the training content, trainer and
logistics at the end of the training session. The training feedback form is online and after
each session the Centre Team will share the link with you which you need to access and
submit your feedback. Do note that we value your honest feedback so you can freely let us
know about your training experience. We will always keep your feedback anonymous, but
take it very seriously.
The training Module is for 16/32/48 hours. Can I just attend just one session and skip the
rest of it?
No. There are certain modules, esp. The ones in Technosaurus : Emerging Technology
course which requires you to attend more than 8 hours of training. This means that you may
have to come for training for consecutive 2/3/4 days to complete the Module. If you do not
attend the first day, you won’t be able to understand the rest of the day’s training. Similarly, if
you attend on the first day but drop out from further sessions, you will not gain knowledge
about the entire module. We highly recommend that you take special efforts to attend such
modules entirely.
If I skip training, can I attend it again?
We recommend that you attend the training along with your other batchmates when it is
arranged. However, in some centers, a particular training is arranged more than once for
another batch. You need to take permission from Centre Team to attend it at another
location with a different batch.
I have an emergency and I cannot attend training, though I confirmed my presence for
the training. What do I do?
If you have a genuine problem, you need to personally call the Centre Manager and inform
her about your absence. You will need to write an email about your absence to the Centre
Team if you confirm your presence and drop out at the last moment.
Will I get a payout for attending training?
Yes. You will receive Rs. 8,100/- for attending 100% training in a semester. Your center team
will keep a record of your attendance to calculate the bi-annual payout.
Whom do I approach for more information about Training and Curriculum?
You can first get in touch with your Centre in charge who will guide you further.

where students from all the Katalyst centers get a chance to bond with one another. They also
